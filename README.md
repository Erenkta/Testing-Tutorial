# Unit & Integration Test Tutorial

This project demonstrates how to write unit tests for different application layers using Mockito.

I implemented tests for:

🛠 Service layer

🌐 Controller layer

💾 Repository layer

Through this project, I gained a solid understanding of how to structure tests, mock dependencies, and apply the general principles behind unit testing in a Spring Boot application.

⚡ Note: Only the test implementations were written by me.
The remaining application code comes from a course I followed.

Purpose

The goal of this project is to strengthen my knowledge of unit testing with Mockito and to gain hands-on experience in applying test-driven practices to different layers of an application.
